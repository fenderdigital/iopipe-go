## Installation

Set the `IOPIPE_TOKEN` environment variable to [your project token](https://dashboard.iopipe.com/install),
import this library, instantiate an agent, and wrap your handler that you expose
to AWS. An example follows:

```go
import (
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"github.com/iopipe/iopipe-go"
)


var agent = iopipe.NewAgent(iopipe.Config{})

func hello() (string, error) {
	return "Hello Æ›!", nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(agent.WrapHandler(hello))
}
```

The `Config` struct offers further options for configuring how your function
interacts with IOpipe, please refer to the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/iopipe/iopipe-go#Config)
